This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Architectural Decisions

### User Creation Flow (Client Record)

For the initial development phase, we are implementing a synchronous process for creating a `Client` record. This means the `Client` record will be created in our database immediately after a user successfully signs up and is redirected back to the application from Clerk.

**TODO:** As the application matures, we should migrate this to a more robust, asynchronous webhook-based system. Using a webhook will decouple our application from Clerk's user creation process, improving reliability and resilience. This will involve setting up a dedicated webhook endpoint and using a tunneling service like `ngrok` for local development.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
